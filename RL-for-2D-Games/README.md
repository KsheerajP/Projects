# FOOTSIES: Reinforcement Learning Agent for 2D Fighting Games

## Overview
This project explores how reinforcement learning can be used to train an AI agent to play a 2D fighting game with strategic decision-making. Inspired by "FOOTSIES," a minimalist fighting game, the agent learns to balance offense, defense, and timing to outperform its opponent.

## How It Works
- The agent is trained using **Deep Q-Learning (DQN)** with a custom reward system that encourages smart movement, attacking when the opponent is vulnerable, and blocking at the right time.
- The environment simulates key mechanics of 2D fighting games such as positioning, hitboxes, and cooldowns.
- Over episodes, the agent learns to anticipate opponent actions and develop counter-strategies.

This project serves as a foundational example of how reinforcement learning can be applied to game AI, especially in genres requiring precision and timing.

## Results
- The trained agent demonstrated competent play against both rule-based and human-like opponents.
- It successfully learned to dodge, punish, and chain actions with proper spacing and timing.
- Performance consistently improved over training epochs, reflecting strategic growth in the agentâ€™s behavior.
