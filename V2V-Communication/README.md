# Vehicle-to-Vehicle Communication Using IoT

## Overview
This project focuses on building a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication system using IoT technologies to enhance road safety and collision prevention. It enables vehicles to exchange real-time data about position, speed, and emergency alerts, providing a smarter transportation framework.

## How It Works
- Each vehicle is equipped with an **Arduino-based embedded module**.
- It uses **GPS** to fetch location coordinates and **GSM** to communicate with nearby vehicles.
- When a vehicle detects abnormal conditions (e.g., sudden braking or obstacle), it sends an alert to nearby vehicles within range.
- The receiving vehicle displays warnings on an onboard LCD or dashboard alert module.

The system simulates **VANET (Vehicular Ad-hoc Network)** principles and can be expanded for real-time traffic routing or emergency response.

## Results
- Demonstrated successful **short-range real-time message exchange** between moving vehicles.
- Improved safety response time by **up to 3â€“4 seconds**, giving drivers more time to react.
- Modular design supports further integration with traffic systems and infrastructure (V2I).
