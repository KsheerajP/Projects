# GRIME: Graphical Image Manipulation and Enhancement Application

## Overview
GRIME is a full-featured image editing application built in Java that supports both graphical and terminal interfaces. It enables users to perform a wide range of image manipulations including compression, filtering, and color adjustments. The system is modular and extensible, designed with a strong emphasis on user interaction and customization.

## How It Works

GRIME is a Java-based image editor that supports:

- A **terminal-based interface** for scripted transformations and batch processing.
- A **graphical Swing interface** with support for real-time previews, histogram displays, and side-by-side comparisons.
- Users can load, edit, preview, and save images in formats like PNG, JPEG, and BMP.

Some of the key features include:
- Blur, Sharpen, Sepia, and Brightness/Contrast filters.
- Color correction, histogram equalization, and **split-view previewing**.
- Image compression using **Haar wavelet transform**.
- RGB channel manipulation and image scaling/downsampling.
- Scripting support for batch editing multiple images.

## Results
- Successfully implemented over **15 transformation features** with consistent performance across formats.
- GUI supports **real-time feedback** for user edits and interactive image comparison.
