### 2. **T-Shirt Size Estimation from Images**  
Vision-based pipeline that estimates T-shirt sizes using MediaPipe, perspective geometry, and a deep learning model trained on anthropometric datasets.  

### 3. **Footsies: Reinforcement Learning Game AI**  
A fighting game AI trained via deep Q-learning to beat human-like opponents by balancing offensive and defensive strategies.  

### 4. **Parkinsonâ€™s Disease Detection**  
Achieved 90% accuracy on real patient data by using voice-based features and models like MLP, SVM, and Random Forest. Integrated SMOTE and feature selection.  

### 5. **Emotion Detection with Music Recommendation**  
Multi-modal emotion detection using facial, voice, and text inputs. Achieved 88%+ accuracy. Recommends music dynamically based on emotion.  

### 6. **V2V Communication System (IoT)**  
Built a VANET-based vehicle-to-vehicle communication system using GPS, GSM, and Arduino modules for collision prevention and traffic safety alerts.  

### 7. **GPS Precision Enhancement Using Kalman & Fuzzy Logic**  

Enhanced GPS accuracy using real-time kinematic techniques, ANFIS, and Kalman filtering. Reduced location error from meters to centimeters.
